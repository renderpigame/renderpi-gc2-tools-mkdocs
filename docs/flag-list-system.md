# Flag List

**Flag List** expands the capabilities of [Local List Variables](https://docs.gamecreator.io/gamecreator/variables/local-list-variables/) by adding a boolean flag to each entry. This flag allows for manual and random flagging, enabling the marking of data entries. 

## Example use case
For instance, in restaurant reservation systems, when a customer is created, they need to be assigned a table seat. Each seat is represented as a marker in a [Local List](https://docs.gamecreator.io/gamecreator/variables/local-list-variables/), flagged as occupied or free. This system facilitates random selection of a free seat for the customer's state machine and simplifies communication of seat availability to other customers.

## Setup
To use this system you need to create a pool for your list by using [Create Flag List Pool](#create-flag-list-pool), give the pool a unique name and assign the Local List Vale to it's parameters
